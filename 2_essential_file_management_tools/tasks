. Find all files in /etc/ bigger than 100K in size
. Find all files and directories in /etc/ which contain "su" in their name and add them to tar archive(this should be done in 1 command)
. Make a hard link to /etc/passwd and save it to /var/tmp/. Then find all files in / with the same inode as /etc/passwd

Create a file with the below bash command:
  $ echo "Test file" > test_file.txt

. Make a soft link(name: soft_link_to_test_file.txt) to that file 
. Make a hard link(name: hard_link_to_test_file.txt) to that file
