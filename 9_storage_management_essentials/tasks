Let's suppose that you have the single disk(ie /dev/sda):

1. Add 2Gb more to existing /dev/sda disk
2. Add additional 3Gb disk to your Ubuntu VM(ie /dev/sdb)
3. Create new partition on /dev/sda to use 2Gb added in step#1
4. Make 2 partitions on /dev/sdb 1.5Gb each

5. Create filesystems on these 3 new partitions:
  /dev/sda{?} - ext4
  /dev/sdb1 - ext4
  /dev/sdb2 - ext3

6. Mount crated filesystems
